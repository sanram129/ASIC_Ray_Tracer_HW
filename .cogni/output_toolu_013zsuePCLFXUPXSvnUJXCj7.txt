[BUG #1 TEST] Out-of-bounds detection
  Ray from (31,15,15) moving in +X direction
  Should exit at boundary, NOT wrap to (0,15,15)
  ✓ PASS: Ray correctly exited bounds (no wrap-around)
    ray_hit=0, ray_timeout=0

[BUG #1 TEST] Negative direction bounds
  Ray from (0,15,15) moving in -X direction
  Should exit at boundary, NOT wrap to (31,15,15)
  ✓ PASS: Ray correctly exited bounds in negative direction

[BUG #2 TEST] Face ID correct on hit
  Ray from (10,10,10) moving in +X, hitting voxel at (15,10,10)
  Expected face_id: 0 (X+ face)
  ✓ PASS: Correct face_id=0 (X+ face) for X-axis ray
    Hit at (15,10,10), face_id=0

[BUG #2 TEST] Y-axis face ID
  Ray from (10,10,10) moving in +Y, hitting voxel at (10,18,10)
  Expected face_id: 2 (Y+ face)
  ✓ PASS: Correct face_id=2 (Y+ face) for Y-axis ray

[BUG #2 TEST] Z-axis face ID
  Ray from (10,10,10) moving in +Z, hitting voxel at (10,10,20)
  Expected face_id: 4 (Z+ face)
  Scene check: voxel_grid[10][10][20] = 1
  Result: ray_hit=1, ray_timeout=0, hit=(10,10,20), face=4, steps=10
  ✓ PASS: Correct face_id=4 (Z+ face) for Z-axis ray

[INTEGRATION TEST] Immediate hit position and face
  Ray starting AT solid voxel (12,12,12)
  Should detect immediate hit with correct position
  ✓ PASS: Immediate hit detected at correct position
    Hit at (12,12,12), steps=0

[INTEGRATION TEST] Simple straight-line path
  Ray from (0,10,10) to (5,10,10) in +X
  ✓ PASS: Hit correct voxel with correct face
